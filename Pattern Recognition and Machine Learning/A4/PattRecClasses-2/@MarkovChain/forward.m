function [alfaHat, c]=forward(mc,pX)%[alfaHat, c]=forward(mc,pX)%calculates state and observation probabilities for one single data sequence,%using the forward algorithm, for a given single MarkovChain object,%to be used when the MarkovChain is included in a HMM object.%%Input:%mc= single MarkovChain object%pX= matrix with state-conditional likelihood values,%   without considering the Markov depencence between sequence samples.%	pX(j,t)= myScale(t)* P( X(t)= observed x(t) | S(t)= j ); j=1..N; t=1..T%	(must be pre-calculated externally)%NOTE: pX may be arbitrarily scaled, as defined externally,%   i.e., pX may not be a properly normalized probability density or mass.%%NOTE: If the HMM has Finite Duration, it is assumed to have reached the end%after the last data element in the given sequence, i.e. S(T+1)=END=N+1.%%Result:%alfaHat=matrix with normalized state probabilities, given the observations:%	alfaHat(j,t)=P[S(t)=j|x(1)...x(t), HMM]; t=1..T%c=row vector with observation probabilities, given the HMM:%	c(t)=P[x(t) | x(1)...x(t-1),HMM]; t=1..T%	c(1)*c(2)*..c(t)=P[x(1)..x(t)| HMM]%   If the HMM has Finite Duration, the last element includes%   the probability that the HMM ended at exactly the given sequence length, i.e.%   c(T+1)= P( S(T+1)=N+1| x(1)...x(T-1), x(T)  )%Thus, for an infinite-duration HMM:%   length(c)=T%   prod(c)=P( x(1)..x(T) )%and, for a finite-duration HMM:%   length(c)=T+1%   prod(c)= P( x(1)..x(T), S(T+1)=END )%%NOTE: IF pX was scaled externally, the values in c are %   correspondingly scaled versions of the true probabilities.%%--------------------------------------------------------%Code Authors:%--------------------------------------------------------T = size(pX,2); %Number of observationsN = nStates(mc); %Number of statesq = mc.InitialProb;A = mc.TransitionProb;c = zeros(1, T);alfa = zeros(N, T);alfaHat = zeros(N, T);isFinite = (N ~= size(A, 2)); %Test finite case% Initializationalfa(:, 1) = q.*pX(:, 1);c(1) = sum(alfa(:, 1));alfaHat(:, 1) = alfa(:, 1) / c(1);% Loopfor t = 2:T    alfa(:, t) = A(:, 1:N)'*alfaHat(:, t-1).*pX(:, t);    c(t) = sum(alfa(:, t));    alfaHat(:, t) = alfa(:, t)/c(t);end% Terminationif isFinite        c(1, end+1) = alfaHat(:, T)' * A(:, N+1);endend
